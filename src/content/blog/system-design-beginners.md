System design is a complex and ever-evolving field but it's also one of the most crucial aspects of building robust scalable applications. This blog post will serve as your guide providing you with a curated list of 25 essential articles to jumpstart your learning journey.

## Laying the Foundation:

### Scalability
[Read more about Scalability](https://rb.gy/i0ne6l)
>This article dives into the concept of scalability, explaining why it matters and the different strategies you can employ to achieve it.

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
[Read more about Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling](https://rb.gy/e4b8yp)
>Now that you understand scalability, it's time to explore the two main approaches: horizontal scaling (adding more machines) and vertical scaling (beefing up existing machines).

### Latency vs Throughput
[Read more about Latency vs Throughput](https://rb.gy/ioqfli)
>Understanding the trade-offs between latency (response time) and throughput (data processing rate) is essential for making informed design decisions.

## Optimizing Performance:

### Load Balancing
[Read more about Load Balancing](https://rb.gy/y5bbnm)
>Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers, ensuring your system can handle peak loads without breaking a sweat.

### Caching
[Read more about Caching](https://lnkd.in/gC9piQbJ)
>Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on your database and speeding up responses.

### ACID Transactions
[Read more about ACID Transactions](https://rb.gy/kd12jw)
>Learn about the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that guarantee data integrity in database transactions.

## Delivering Content:

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
[Read more about CDN](https://rb.gy/eu78ck)
>CDNs store static content like images and videos on geographically distributed servers, reducing latency for users worldwide.

## Data Consistency and Processing:

### Strong vs Eventual Consistency
[Read more about Data Consistency](https://rb.gy/gd4kg6)
>Data consistency refers to whether all users see the same data at the same time. This article explains the differences between strong and eventual consistency models.

### Batch Processing vs Stream Processing
[Read more about Processing Methods](https://rb.gy/zb2xwr)
>Batch processing handles large datasets in bulk, while stream processing deals with continuous data streams in real-time. Understand which approach suits your needs.

## Communication and Architecture:

### Concurrency vs Parallelism
[Read more about Concurrency and Parallelism](https://rb.gy/vfctb8)
>Grasp the concepts of concurrency (multiple tasks executing simultaneously) and parallelism (utilizing multiple processors) for efficient task handling.

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communications
[Read more about Communication Methods](https://rb.gy/bovoq6)
>Synchronous communication involves waiting for a response before proceeding, while asynchronous communication allows tasks to continue without waiting.

### REST vs RPC
[Read more about REST vs RPC](https://rb.gy/7fskpt)
>Both REST and RPC are popular communication protocols, but they have different strengths and use cases.

### CAP Theorem
[Read more about CAP Theorem](https://rb.gy/85olkv)
>This fundamental theorem states that you can only have two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Understanding CAP helps you make informed design choices.

## Advanced Concepts:

### Reverse Proxy
[Read more about Reverse Proxy](https://rb.gy/ed9re9)
>A reverse proxy sits in front of your servers, handling tasks like load balancing, security, and caching.

### Domain Name System (DNS)
[Read more about DNS](https://rb.gy/d1xl6c)
>DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand.

### Rate Limiting
[Read more about Rate Limiting](https://rb.gy/uodx7d)
>Prevent abuse and overload by limiting the number of requests a user or service can make within a given timeframe.
