## Laying the Foundation

### Scalability
[Read more about Scalability](https://rb.gy/i0ne6l)
> Scalability is the ability of a system to handle growing amounts of work by adding resources. This article dives into the concept of scalability, explaining why it matters and the different strategies you can employ to achieve it.

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
[Read more about Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling](https://rb.gy/e4b8yp)
> Scaling your system can be done in two ways:
> - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to your pool of resources
> - **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power to your existing machines

### Latency vs Throughput
[Read more about Latency vs Throughput](https://rb.gy/ioqfli)
> Understanding the trade-offs between latency (response time) and throughput (data processing rate) is essential for making informed design decisions.

## Optimizing Performance

### Load Balancing
[Read more about Load Balancing](https://rb.gy/y5bbnm)
> Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers, ensuring your system can handle peak loads without breaking a sweat.

### Caching
[Read more about Caching](https://lnkd.in/gC9piQbJ)
> Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on your database and speeding up responses.

### ACID Transactions
[Read more about ACID Transactions](https://rb.gy/kd12jw)
> ACID properties ensure data integrity in database transactions:
> - **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together
> - **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state
> - **Isolation**: Transactions don't interfere with each other
> - **Durability**: Committed changes are permanent

## Delivering Content

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
[Read more about CDN](https://rb.gy/eu78ck)
> CDNs store static content like images and videos on geographically distributed servers, reducing latency for users worldwide.

## Data Consistency and Processing

### Strong vs Eventual Consistency
[Read more about Data Consistency](https://rb.gy/gd4kg6)
> Data consistency models determine how data is synchronized across distributed systems:
> - **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
> - **Eventual Consistency**: All nodes will eventually see the same data

### Batch Processing vs Stream Processing
[Read more about Processing Methods](https://rb.gy/zb2xwr)
> Different approaches to data processing:
> - **Batch Processing**: Handling large datasets in bulk
> - **Stream Processing**: Processing continuous data streams in real-time

## Communication and Architecture

### Concurrency vs Parallelism
[Read more about Concurrency and Parallelism](https://rb.gy/vfctb8)
> Understanding task execution:
> - **Concurrency**: Multiple tasks executing simultaneously
> - **Parallelism**: Utilizing multiple processors for faster execution

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communications
[Read more about Communication Methods](https://rb.gy/bovoq6)
> Different communication patterns:
> - **Synchronous**: Waiting for a response before proceeding
> - **Asynchronous**: Continuing without waiting for responses

### REST vs RPC
[Read more about REST vs RPC](https://rb.gy/7fskpt)
> API design patterns:
> - **REST**: Resource-based, stateless architecture
> - **RPC**: Procedure-based, function call architecture

### CAP Theorem
[Read more about CAP Theorem](https://rb.gy/85olkv)
> The fundamental theorem of distributed systems:
> - **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data
> - **Availability**: Every request receives a response
> - **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network partitions

## Advanced Concepts

### Reverse Proxy
[Read more about Reverse Proxy](https://rb.gy/ed9re9)
> A reverse proxy provides:
> - Load balancing
> - Security
> - Caching
> - SSL termination

### Domain Name System (DNS)
[Read more about DNS](https://rb.gy/d1xl6c)
> DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand.

### Rate Limiting
[Read more about Rate Limiting](https://rb.gy/uodx7d)
> Rate limiting prevents abuse by:
> - Limiting request frequency
> - Protecting against DDoS attacks
> - Ensuring fair resource usage

## Conclusion

Understanding these system design concepts is crucial for building scalable and reliable applications. Remember that system design is an iterative process, and the best solutions often combine multiple approaches based on your specific requirements.
